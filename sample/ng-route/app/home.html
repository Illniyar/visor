Welcome to Visor's example application.<br/>
This application is designed to demonstrate navigation and routing restriction using Visor and angular-ui-router. <br/>
<br/>
You are at the `Home` route. You can access this route at any point. <br/>
At the top there are 4 routes: <br/>
<ul>
    <li>Home - this route, which you can always access</li>
    <li>Private - which you can access only after logging in. Trying to access the private route if you are not
        authenticated will redirect to login.
    </li>
    <li>Admin - which only users who are admins can access. You can login as admin in the login page</li>
    <li>Login - on the right side you can access the login page that would let you log in</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This application uses cookies to remember if you are logged in or not. So you can test routes by also refreshing the window.
